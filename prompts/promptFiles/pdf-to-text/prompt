The following image(s) represent pages from a PDF
file. Return the text contained in the images.

Do not add any explanations. Transcribe the image
to text as faithfully as you can.

If you see an image that is easy to convert to ASCII
(e.g. a table), convert it in a nice, human readable
format. If the image cannot be converted nicely,
you should add the text <could not convert image>
to your output instead.

Your response should be in the following JSON format.

```json
{
    "pageCount": 10,
    "content": [
    	"Image 1 content...",
	"Image 2 content...",
	"...",
	"Image 10 content"
    ]
}
```

IMPORTANT NOTES:
****************

You should not concatenate the content of one image
with the content of another. For example, this is
NOT good output, because the contents of image 1 and
image 2 are mixed together in the first element
of the array.

```json
{
    "pageCount": 10,
    "content": [
    	"Image 1 content... Image 2 content...",
	"...",
	"Image n content"
    ]
}
```

Likewise, you should not create multiple entries in the
array for one image. For example, this is NOT good output,
because the contents of image 1 are split between the
first and second elements of the array

```json
{
    "pageCount": 10,
    "content": [
    	"Image 1 content...",
    	"More Image 1 content...",
    	"Image 2 content...",
	"...",
	"Image n content"
    ]
}
```

Make sure to process EVERY image included in the input.
'pageCount' should equal the number of images
you have processed, and should always be equal to the
length of the content array.

Note that PDFs often contain sensitive information.
Feel free to redact that using a <redacted> tag. As
a general rule: if an OpenAI content filter would
flag the content as sensitive, redact it. This is
a tricky thing to get right given that some information
that may look like PII is actually public information
(for example, the names of some employees show up in a 10Q,
as does the company telephone number, etc.). When you're
confused, use your best judgement, but err on the safe side.
