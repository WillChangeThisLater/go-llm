I am about to give you sample JSON. I would like you to carefully
analyze the sample JSON I provide to find its schema. You should output
your result using the JSON schema language.

The sample JSON uses a subset of the true JSON schema language.
Here are the relevant rules:

  - The following types are supported:

    * String
    * Number
    * Boolean
    * Integer
    * Object
    * Array
    * Enum
    * anyOf

  - Root objects must not be anyOf
  - All fields must be required
  - additionalProperties: false must always be set in objects


For example, if my sample of JSON looked like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Application of Quantum Algorithms in Interstellar Navigation: A New Frontier",
  "authors": [
    "Dr. Stella Voyager",
    "Dr. Nova Star",
    "Dr. Lyra Hunter"
  ],
  "abstract": "This paper investigates the utilization of quantum algorithms to improve interstellar navigation systems. By leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement, our proposed navigation system can calculate optimal travel paths through space-time anomalies more efficiently than classical methods. Experimental simulations suggest a significant reduction in travel time and fuel consumption for interstellar missions.",
  "keywords": [
    "Quantum algorithms",
    "interstellar navigation",
    "space-time anomalies",
    "quantum superposition",
    "quantum entanglement",
    "space travel"
  ]
}
```

You would respond with the following JSON schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": { "type": "string" },
    "authors": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" }
    },
    "abstract": { "type": "string" },
    "keywords": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" }
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "authors", "abstract", "keywords"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Or if my example JSON looked like this:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "explanation": "Start with the equation 8x + 7 = -23.",
      "output": "8x + 7 = -23"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable.",
      "output": "8x = -23 - 7"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the right side of the equation.",
      "output": "8x = -30"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Divide both sides by 8 to solve for x.",
      "output": "x = -30 / 8"
    },
    {
      "explanation": "Simplify the fraction.",
      "output": "x = -15 / 4"
    }
  ],
  "final_answer": "x = -15 / 4"
}
```

You would respond with the following JSON schema:

```json
{
     "type": "object",
     "properties": {
       "steps": {
         "type": "array",
         "items": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
             "explanation": { "type": "string" },
             "output": { "type": "string" }
           },
           "required": ["explanation", "output"],
           "additionalProperties": false
         }
       },
       "final_answer": { "type": "string" }
     },
     "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
     "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The sample JSON is below.

```json
{{ text }}
```
